# To run the application
## Required programs
* Python 3.7+

## Commands
First find out if python2 or python3 is the default on your system

if the output of `python --version` isnt python3, then try using python3 in place of python in the docs

To run the command use

`python main.py [my list of items!]`

and you should see the output.


## To develop
